1. APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing) 

 
 APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing) refers to the self-assignment of IP addresses in the 169.254.0.0/16 address range when a client cannot obtain an IP address from a DHCP server. Here are some key points about APIPA:
 
 - The 169.254.0.0/16 subnet is reserved for APIPA. Addresses in this range are not routable on the public internet.
 - APIPA is used as a fallback mechanism when a DHCP client fails to get an IP address from a DHCP server. This provides basic connectivity between two hosts on the same isolated network.
 - When APIPA is activated, the client randomly selects an address from 169.254.1.0 to 169.254.254.255 and assigns it to the interface after first checking for conflicts.
 - The subnet mask used with APIPA is 255.255.0.0. This allows for 65,534 unique host addresses in the 169.254.0.0 network.
 - APIPA only provides automatic IP addressing. Other information like default gateway, DNS servers, etc. will not be available unless manually configured.
 - APIPA addresses are meant for temporary use within a single isolated network. Devices will replace the APIPA address with a DHCP-assigned address once a DHCP server becomes available.
 - APIPA is enabled by default on Microsoft Windows and many other operating systems. It can also be disabled if not needed.
 - APIPA helps avoid IP conflicts and allows basic network connectivity when a DHCP server is unavailable. But it does not provide full network functionality like internet access or domain name resolution.
 
 So in summary, APIPA provides self-assigned link-local IP addressing as a last resort when no DHCP server can be contacted. It enables basic connectivity between hosts on a single LAN. It is a network protocol used in Windows operating systems that allows a computer to automatically assign itself an IP address when it cannot obtain a valid IP address from a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server.
