1. MAC ADDRESS 


 		/* A Media Access Control (MAC) address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) or network adapter. It is a ==48-bit number== (usually represented as a series of six hexadecimal numbers separated by colons or hyphens) that is permanently assigned to a device's hardware during manufacturing.
 	
 		The MAC address serves as a unique identifier for a device on a network. It is used at the data link layer of the OSI model to facilitate communication between devices within a local area network (LAN). Every device connected to a network, such as a computer, smartphone, or network printer, has its own unique MAC address.
 	
 		The MAC address is embedded in the network adapter's firmware and is independent of the device's IP address. It is used by network switches and routers to route data packets to the correct destination on a local network. MAC addresses are not typically used for communication across different networks (such as the Internet) since they are specific to a local network.*/

 	
 	
 		Example: ==MAC address: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E==
