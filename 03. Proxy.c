1. PROXY 



		Here are many types of proxy services, but the key ones are:

		   - Dedicated Proxy / Forward Proxy //The Forward Proxy, is what most people imagine a proxy to be. A Forward Proxy is when a client makes a request to a computer, and that computer carries out the request.

		   - Reverse Proxy //As you may have guessed, a reverse proxy, is the reverse of a Forward Proxy. Instead of being designed to filter outgoing requests, it filters incoming ones. The most common goal with a Reverse Proxy, is to listen on an address and forward it to a closed-off network. Many organizations use CloudFlare as they have a robust network that can withstand most DDOS Attacks. By using Cloudflare, organizations have a way to filter the amount (and type) of traffic that gets sent to their webservers.

		   - Transparent Proxy   //With a transparent proxy, the client doesn't know about its existence. The transparent proxy intercepts the client's communication requests to the Internet and acts as a substitute instance. To the outside, the transparent proxy, like the non-transparent proxy, acts as a communication partner.
