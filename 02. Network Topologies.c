 1. NETWORK TOPOLOGIES 

 

A network topology refers to the typical arrangement and physical or logical connections of devices within a network. Computers act as hosts, including clients and servers, that actively utilize the 
network. It also encompasses network components like switches, bridges, and routers— which we will explore in more detail in later sections— that facilitate distribution and ensure all network hosts
can establish logical connections with one another. The network topology influences the selection of components and the access methods used for the transmission media.



 	We can divide the entire network topology area into three areas:


	1. Connections

		Wired connections 		Wireless connections
		Coaxial cabling 		Wi-Fi
		Glass fiber cabling 	Cellular
		Twisted-pair cabling 	Satellite
		and others 					and others




 	Here are some of the most important and commonly used network topologies:
 	
 		1. Bus topology - All devices are connected to a common central cable called a bus. Easy to set up but entire network is brought down if bus fails.
 		2. Star topology - All nodes connect to a central switch/hub. Easy to troubleshoot and modify but centralized device is a single point of failure.
 		3. Ring topology - Nodes connect in a circular fashion with each node connecting to the next. Failure of one node breaks the ring.
 		4. Mesh topology - Nodes connect directly to as many other nodes as possible. Redundant and robust but complex to set up.
 		5. Tree topology - Hierachical like branches of a tree. Useful for wide area networks.
 		6. Hybrid topology - Combination of multiple topologies. For example - Bus within departments and interconnected via ring topology.
 	


 	//The most common topology today is star topology due to easy installation and management through central hubs/switches. Bus topology is still used within racks and chassis level networks. Mesh topologies commonly implemented in large scale networks to provide redundancy.
