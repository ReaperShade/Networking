 1. DYNAMIC IP 


 
      A dynamic IP address is an IP address that is assigned automatically and can change periodically. Here are some key points about dynamic IP addresses:
    	
      /*
    	- Dynamic IP addresses are commonly assigned by a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server.
    	- They are leased to devices for a period of time, rather than being permanently assigned like a static IP address.
    	- When a device's lease expires, the DHCP server will assign it a new dynamic IP address.
    	- Devices such as home computers, smartphones and laptops usually receive dynamic IP addresses.
    	- The benefit is that IP addresses can be automatically reused when devices leave the network, reducing the need for more IP addresses.
    	- A downside is that because the IP can change, it can be hard to identify or access a device reliably.
    	- Dynamic IPs are temporary and reused over time, while static IPs are permanent.
    	- To maintain a consistent IP, some devices such as servers and printers use static IP assignment even if the network uses DHCP.
    	- Dynamic IP allocation allows flexibility and reduced manual IP management on large networks where devices attach intermittently.
    	
    	In summary, dynamic IP addressing provides an automated and efficient way to assign IP addresses compared to static IP assignment, at the cost of persistency.*/

 










 2. STATIC IP 


 
    A static IP address is an IP address that is permanently assigned to a device on a network. Here are some key points about static IP addresses:
 	
   /*
  	- Static IPs are manually configured on a device, rather than being automatically assigned like dynamic IP addresses.
  	- They do not change over time, unlike dynamic IPs which are leased for a period of time.
  	- Devices like servers, printers, and networking equipment are commonly set up with static IPs.
  	- They are appropriate for devices that require permanent availability on a network.
  	- Static IP assignment simplifies access to critical devices by providing a constant IP address.
  	- They help avoid conflicts with IP address assignments on a network. 
  	- One limitation is that static IPs are not reusable if a device is removed from the network.
  	- Proper IP management is required to track assigned static IPs and avoid overlap.
  	- Reserving IP ranges for static assignment helps avoid conflicts with dynamic IP allocation.
  	- Static IPs are configured on the device itself and reserved on the DHCP server to ensure they are not dynamically assigned.
  	- Overall, static IPs provide permanency, reliability and easy access to devices at the cost of decreased IP flexibility.*/
 	
  	In summary, static IP addresses identify devices permanently on a network and allow easy access and identification of critical infrastructure and services.
