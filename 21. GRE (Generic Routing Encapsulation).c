GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation)

 
	 /*Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) is a tunneling protocol that can encapsulate many protocols inside IP tunnels. Some examples would be routing protocols such as EIGRP and OSPF and the routed protocol IPv6.
	 
	 As the data is passed down each layer of the model, more information containing details specific to the layer in question is added on to the start of thE transmission.
	 Notice that the encapsulated data is given a different name at different steps of the process. In layers 7,6 and 5, the data is simply referred to as data. In the transport layer 
	 the encapsulated data is referred to as a segment or a datagram (depending on whether TCP or UDP has been selected as a transmission protocol).
	 At the Network Layer, the data is referred to as a packet. When the packet gets passed down to the Data Link layer it becomes a frame, and by the time its transmitted across a network the frame has been broken down into bits.
